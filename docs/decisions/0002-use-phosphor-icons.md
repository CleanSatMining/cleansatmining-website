# Use Phosphor Icons as icons library

## Context

To develop the front and integrate the screens, an icon library is required.

## Considered options

- [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/)
- [PhosphorIcons](https://phosphoricons.com/)

## Decision

Chosen option : PhosphorIcons. The choice of icons is larger than HeroIcons and the library has already been successfuly used on another project.
The weight of the library has been greatly reduced with their V2.

## Consequences

All icons used will be from phosphor-icons and will match the designed screens.
